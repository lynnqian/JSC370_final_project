Nowadays, we have so many apps on our phone and computers and everyone’s life is associated with them. I want to know people’s opinion on different apps and whether they favor some apps with particular characteristics than others. I have narrowed my target to apps on Google Play Store.

The primary question of interest is: What are the factors for different app’s rating?

This question can be decomposed into smaller questions:

* What is the association between number of reviews and rating of the app?
* What is the association between number of installs and the rating of the app?
* What is the association between the category of the app and the rating of the app?
* What is the association between the size of the app and the rating of the app?
